I am passionate about the Web, I believe that all web applications live in a distributed network that works together in order to make peoples life easier. Each application comes with its own unique set of problems and challenges, solving those problems, facing those challenges is what motivates me the most.

I have been working on web technologies for nearly 10 years, the last five years have been the most exciting part of my career dabbling in modern web tech such as angular and react. I enjoy implementing good user experiences, graphics programming and they are strengths too.

Apart from coding I do a lot travelling, enjoy the journey more than the destiny. a champion at binge watching tv shows, love fictional books with a mixture of real world history. My favourite sport to watch is football (la liga "hala madrid!"), and F1. favourite sport to play is cricket cause its mostly standing around in a field.
